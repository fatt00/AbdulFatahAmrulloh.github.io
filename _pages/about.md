## About Me

I am a passionate technology enthusiast and a graduate of Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunication Engineering from Telkom University. My interests lie in Internet of Things (IoT), Adaptive Networks, and smart network simulation. With experience in developing projects based on ad-hoc vehicle networks (VANET) and utilizing various simulation platforms and web development, I am dedicated to solving complex technical challenges through collaboration, communication, and creativity.

## My Work and Research

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have been committed to expanding the frontiers of knowledge in the field of telecommunications and IoT.

**Current Research Endeavors:**

In my recent work, I have focused on developing decision support systems for complex network environments, emphasizing optimization and machine learning techniques. This foundational experience has enriched my understanding of data-driven solutions.

**Smart Fish Farm Android (SMAFI):**

I developed the user interface for SMAFI, a smart fish farm Android application focused on fish farming investment. This project involved managing the program using Android Studio, using Flutter with Dart programming language.

**Simulation of Ad-Hoc On Demand Distance Vector (AODV) Routing Protocol on VANETs:**

I developed a simulation system for ad-hoc vehicle networks (VANET) with AODV protocol using SUMO and OMNeT++ applications. This project involved analyzing parameters such as end-to-end delay, throughput, and packet delivery ratio, and creating a website to display simulation results and visualize parameters interactively and in real-time.

IoT-Based Soil Monitoring:
I have been involved in projects that focus on enhancing soil monitoring for smart agriculture. These projects include:
Smart Soil Monitoring IoT-Based NPK Detection with Python: GitHub Repository
IoT-Based Soil Moisture Monitoring for Smart Agriculture: GitHub Repository
These projects aim to improve the efficiency of soil management in agriculture using IoT technologies.

**Future Exploration:**

As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I am motivated by my passion for exploring the cutting-edge of IoT and its applications in various fields. My research path is a reflection of my commitment to unlocking potential through data-driven innovations.
