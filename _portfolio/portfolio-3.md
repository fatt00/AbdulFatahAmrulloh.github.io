This project involved the development of a real-time monitoring dashboard for **Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs)** implemented on Jl. Jend. Sudirman, Purwokerto. The system tracks key performance indicators of network routing protocols and compares multiple simulation datasets.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Displays critical network metrics including *Throughput*, *Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)*, and *End-to-End Delay (EED)* in real-time.
- **Historical Data Comparison**: Allows users to load and compare multiple simulation results stored in CSV format.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Line and bar charts show variations in performance over time and across simulations.
- **Control Panel**: Provides user options to load data, clear history, and save results through a simple interface.


## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js or similar JS libraries
- **Backend/Data Handling**: CSV Parser, WebSocket for real-time feed
- **Frameworks**: Possibly built with React.js or Vue.js and styled using Tailwind CSS

## Outcome

This dashboard enables:
- Performance evaluation of routing protocols in VANET scenarios.
- Real-time and historical data-driven decision-making.
- Academic and smart transportation research based on inter-vehicle communication networks.
