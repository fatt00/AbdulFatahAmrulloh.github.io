This project involved developing a system for monitoring Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels in soil using IoT technology. The system was designed to provide real-time data on soil fertility, helping farmers make informed decisions about fertilization.

## Key Features

- **Sensor Integration**: Integrated soil NPK sensors to measure nutrient levels accurately.
- **Data Collection**: Collected data using Arduino and transmitted it via Modbus communication.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Enabled real-time monitoring of soil conditions through a web application.
- **User Interface**: Developed a user-friendly interface for easy access to soil nutrient data.

## Technologies Used

- **Sensors**: Soil NPK Sensor
- **Communication**: Modbus, SIM800L Module
- **Programming Languages**: Python, C++
- **Web Development**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **IoT Platform**: Blynk

## Outcome

The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of IoT in monitoring soil nutrients. The system provided accurate and timely data, which can be accessed through a smartphone or computer, allowing farmers to effectively manage their crops.
